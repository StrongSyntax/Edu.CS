# KAHSVisualizer
A few tools to aid in the visualization of every attendee in the school's 61-year history.

This has been tested on Python 3.11.6

this requires a few libraries, to install them, type this into your command prompt:

pip install matplotlib

pip install wordcloud

pip install panda

(this requires tkinter, but tkinter comes with every Python install. if you receive a module error from tkinter, run "pip install tkinter" .)

(when prompted for the text files path, just drag and drop the input.txt onto the program, and press enter)

have fun!
