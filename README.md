This is a repo containing every programming tool/project I have done for school.

> Recently Added A Climatograph Visualizer To View The Effects Of Climate Change.

Most, (if not all), of these tools are written in python.

Here are the required libraries:

```
matplotlib

wordcloud

panda

tkinter

json

argparse

numpy
```

# Documentation:

## Naming Project Visualizer

I'll redo this later.

## Climatograph Visualizer

Won't likely be used by anyone, but one day I'll get around to writing this.

Enjoy ;)
