      <h3>Power Outages</h3>
      <p>Recently, power outages have swept through all of Alberta due to extremely high power demand, and low supply as a direct effect. Emergency alerts have gone out, and people don't seem to care. On a happier note, I'm almost on exam break and I'm very excited. Dylan Strong - 14, 01, 2024</p>

    <h2>Peer Review</h2>
    <p>This assignment was very last minute, so I did not recieve a peer review. This is due to my decision to do this website on my own, after exploring what weebly has to offer. In my opinion, Weebly is mediocre at best and I want my work to be exactly how I imagined it, hence my decision to move forward on this path.

      Sorry..
